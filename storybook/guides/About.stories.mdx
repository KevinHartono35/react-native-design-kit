# About
All in one react native material design

## Background
When I look for design materials when making applications, I find it difficult because each component is spread in different libraries. 

The available components also only provide a basic form without further developing the potential of each componen. So, to create advanced features we have to develop it again.

## Goal
The purpose of this library is to provide all components and develop each potential in the component and makes it easy to use.

The long-term goal is that this library will be used by many applications and supported by many developers.
